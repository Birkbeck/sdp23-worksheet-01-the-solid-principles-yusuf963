# Open/Closed Principle

**Software entitites should be open for extension, but closed for modification**

In this example, any time we want to add a new style of greeting, we have to change the Greeter class to accept a new type of personality. We don't want to have to modify our existing, working code to add something new. 

How would you correct this situation?
